## Description

RecycleAI

A waste management & recycling copilot addressing a solution at some of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from the UN SDGs (https://sdgs.un.org/goals) which are:

- **{1}** [No poverty](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal1)
- **{2}** [Zero Hunger](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2)
- **{13}** [Climate action](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13)
- **{17}** [Partnerships for the goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal17)

 An app focused on promoting waste reduction, recycling, and environmental conservation efforts in African communities. RecycleAI can provide users with tips on waste management, recycling facilities locations, and eco-friendly alternatives to single-use plastics. The app can also organize community clean-up events, waste collection drives, and recycling competitions to raise awareness and mobilize collective action. Moreover, it can feature educational content on the environmental impact of waste pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate change, inspiring individuals to adopt sustainable lifestyle practices and become stewards of the planet.

### Main goal

The first goal of RecycleIA to help people in managing their waste and recycling them to recycling companies nearby. For such case, the user will be instructed at launch about recycling and waste management. They will be guided on how to separate their rubbish between what is recyclable and what is not. To do so, they can take a picture of an item for the system intelligence to recognize it and provide them with a guide on how to proceed if recyclable.
    
For the recyclable objects, the system will look into its database to find recycle companies nearby so that the user can go to dispose of their waste. They will be then recompensed of points that can then be used to buy things from sponsored or accredited shops.

### Alt. goal

The second goals between people and people. Let us say that a Mr. A have an old phone that he wants to dispose of it. He can take a picture of that phone, to share it on the application so that Mrs. B who is in need of a phone can then request it in exchange for something else in her possession that might interest Mr. A. they will then meet and exchange their belongings. Or Mr. can just give away his phone to someone in need.
