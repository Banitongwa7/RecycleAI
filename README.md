## Description

RecycleAI
A waste management & recycling copilot addressing a solution at some of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from the UN SDGs (https://sdgs.un.org/goals) which are:

- **{1}** [No poverty](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal1)
- **{2}** [Zero Hunger](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2)
- **{13}** [Climate action](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13)
- **{17}** [Partnerships for the goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal17)

### Main goal

    The first goal of RecycleIA to help people in managing their waste and recycling them to recycling companies nearby. For such case, the user will be instructed at launch about recycling and waste management. They will be guided on how to separate their rubbish between what is recyclable and what is not. To do so, they can take a picture of an item for the system intelligence to recognize it and provide them with a guide on how to proceed if recyclable.
    
    For the recyclable objects, the system will look into its database to find recycle companies nearby so that the user can go to dispose of their waste. They will be then recompensed of points that can then be used to buy things from sponsored or accredited shops.

### Alt. goal

    The second goals between people and people. Let us say that a Mr. A have an old phone that he wants to dispose of it. He can take a picture of that phone, to share it on the application so that Mrs. B who is in need of a phone can then request it in exchange for something else in her possession that might interest Mr. A. they will then meet and exchange their belongings. Or Mr. can just give away his phone to someone in need.
